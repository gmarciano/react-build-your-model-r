# Build your Model R

First React study.
I had 10 days to pick a stack of my liking and build the suggested application. I chose React along SCSS and just vanilla JS.

This is an app where you can sort of build a car and review your choices at the end.
You're able to choose it's engine, color and wheels set. (We all love Teslas, don't we?)

## Overall impression

React is awesome.
I really liked the freedom it gives you and ease to access other component's assets (like functions & props) aswell as interact with them.
