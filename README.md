# Build your Model R

First React study.
I had 10 days to pick a stack of my liking and build the suggested application. I chose React along SCSS and vanilla JS.

This is an app where you can sort of build a car and review your choices at the end.
You're able to choose it's engine, color and wheels set. (We all love Teslas, don't we?)

## Overall impression

React is awesome.
I really liked the freedom it gives you and ease to access other component's assets (like functions & props) as well as interact with them.

### Issues faced

    * Context API: It's simple AS SOON AS YOU GET IT. For me it took three long days, thus causing my deadline to get screwed.
    * To keep a straight design pattern facing a framework for the first time.

### Things to improve

    * Responsivity is not even a thing. My deadline is over and i couldn't implement it. Yet. I'll keep updating this until it's good enough.
    * Code is a mess. I developed a SCSS architecture called SpaghettiCSS. Do not dare trying it at home. **Needs** refactor.
    * Header/Navbar doesn't have an indicator for inactive links.
    * Lacks transitions between stages.

# How to run the app

Simply **npm install** & **npm start**.
